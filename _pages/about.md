I am currently a PhD student in applied physics at Stanford University (2018 - 2024), fortunately advised by Prof. [Shanhui Fan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BECu7wYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), with a PhD minor in statistics. Before coming to Stanford, I completed a B.Eng. from National University of Singapore (2015-2018), with a double major in engineering science and physics plus a minor in computer science. 

Research
======
My research interest is broad, but judging from publications, my main focus is on photonic crystal and optical information processing. I am also inerested in machine learning, with a few course projects on arxiv. My undergraduate research was mainly on ion-trap quantum computing. I also worked on a mathy project about pseudomodular groups with Prof Tan Ser Peow. I hope to work on brain-machine interface as a test subject someday.

Hobbies
------
In my spare time, I play various sports. My recent favorite would be climbing, skiing and surfing. I am also developing my fully-wired brain to learn piano.
