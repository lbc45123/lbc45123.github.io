I am currently a PhD student in Applied Physics at Stanford University (2018 - ?), fortunately advised by Prof. Shanhui Fan. Before coming to Stanford, I completed a B.Eng. from National University of Singapore, with a double major in engineering science and physics plus a minor in computer science. 

My research interest is broad, but judging from publications, my main focus is on photonic crystal and optical information processing. I am also inerested in machine learning, with a few course projects uploaded by my friends on arxiv. My undergraduate research was mainly on ion-trap quantum computing. I also worked on a mathy project about pseudomodular groups with Prof Tan Ser Peow. I hope to work on brain-machine interface as a test subject someday.

In my spare time, I play various sports. My recent favorite would be skiing, climbing and surfing. I am also developing my fully-wired brain to learn piano.
