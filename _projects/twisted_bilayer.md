### Problem
Photonic crystals are periodic and well-studied. 
Twisted bilayer photonic crystals are quasi-periodic and show disorder-like properties, even though the structure is highly ordered.
For long, people cannot exactly compute the properties of this system and treated it like disorder.

### Our work
- **Theory and algorithm:** We came up with an algorithm to compute such systems exactly for all cases in general and effective theories for the phenomenon {% cite myprl rcwa4d %}.
- **Experimental verification:** We verify our theory and numerical results with experiment {% cite mysci mysci2 %}.
- **Applications enabled:** We work out all the details to use it for device applications {% cite myacs beamsteer sensing %}.
