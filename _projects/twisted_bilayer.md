### Problem
Photonic crystals are periodic and well-studied. 
Twisted bilayer photonic crystals are quasi-periodic and show disorder-like properties, even though the structure is highly ordered.
For long, people cannot exactly compute the properties of this system and treated it like disorder. Exact solutions only exist for special cases of certain twist angles.

### Our work
- **Theory and algorithm:** We came up with an algorithm to compute such systems exactly for all cases in general and effective theories for the phenomenon {% cite myprl rcwa4d %}.
- **Experimental verification:** We verify our theory and numerical results with experiment {% cite mysci mysci2 %}.
- **Applications enabled:** We work out all the details to use it for device applications {% cite myacs beamsteer sensing %}.
