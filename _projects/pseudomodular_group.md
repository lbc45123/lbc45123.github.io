### Problem
`Modular group` is a fundamental concept that is especially important for hyperbolic geometry. 
It has a clean `definition` (isomorphic to a specific group) and a nice `property` (its orbit is all rational numbers).
For long, people have been speculating `property <=> definition`,
until the first counter-example, known as `pseudomodular group`, that also has the nice property despite not modular by definition.
But how many pseudomodular groups are there? Most importantly, are there finitely many, or infinitely many?


### Answer
In short, yes. 
We came up with a construction method that can give infinitely many commensurability classes that are not modular. Each of them has the nice property of having an orbit of all rational numbers.
